# Samurai

Samurai is a **high-performance, low-latency** Linux kernel optimized for workloads that demand extreme responsiveness. It is **not a generic-use kernel**‚Äîit is stripped down to the bare essentials, built for **Edge, VoIP, Gaming, and VPNs**, where every microsecond counts.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings & Limitations

- **Not designed for general-purpose use.** Samurai is highly optimized and minimal‚Äîdon‚Äôt expect it to work on your smart fridge. üßä
- **Security mitigations removed.** To maximize performance, Samurai disables mitigations like Spectre/Meltdown patches. Use in trusted environments.
- **Minimal driver support.** Unused modules, drivers, and file systems have been stripped out. Check compatibility before use.
- **Logging & debugging overhead eliminated.** Samurai prioritizes raw performance over diagnostics. If you need extensive logs, this isn't the kernel for you.

## üî• Key Features

- **Extreme Low Latency:** Configured with **PREEMPT** and fine-tuned scheduling for ultra-responsive performance.
- **Tickless Kernel (NO_HZ_FULL @ 1000Hz):** Eliminates unnecessary timer interrupts, reducing overhead in real-time workloads.
- **Lightweight & Minimal:** Unused modules, drivers, and file systems removed for a streamlined footprint.
- **Security & Debugging Overheads Removed:** No **SELinux, CPU mitigations, or excessive logging**, ensuring maximum efficiency.
- **Optimized I/O Performance:** Uses **mq-deadline** scheduler for reduced disk latency.
- **eBPF/XDP Ready:** JIT always enabled for high-performance packet processing in networking applications.

## Boot Time Performance

The results below showcase a significant improvement compared to the default Debian kernel.

**Testing Environment for Samurai Kernel:**

* **VM:** KVM Infra (**Shared resources**)
* **CPU:** 2 Cores
* **RAM:** 4GB

**Samurai Kernel Boot Time:**

* **Kernel Boot Time:** 0.6 seconds
* **Full System Boot Time (to userspace):** 2 seconds

**Comparison with Default Debian Kernel:**

The default Debian kernel was previously tested on a server with the following specifications:
* **VM:** KVM Infra (**Shared resources**)
* **CPU:** 4 Cores
* **RAM:** 8GB

**Default Debian Kernel Boot Time (Approximate):**

* **Kernel Boot Time:** 3 seconds
* **Full System Boot Time (to userspace):** 6 seconds

**Performance Improvement:**

Based on these tests, the **Samurai** kernel demonstrates a remarkable improvement in boot time, even when running on a virtual machine with fewer resources:

* **Kernel Boot Time Improvement:**
    * Improvement: 3 seconds - 0.6 seconds = 2.4 seconds
    * Percentage Improvement: (2.4 / 3) * 100 = **80% faster** than the default Debian kernel boot time.

* **Full System Boot Time Improvement:**
    * Improvement: 6 seconds - 2 seconds = 4 seconds
    * Percentage Improvement: (4 / 6) * 100 ‚âà **66.67% faster** than the default Debian full system boot time.

These results highlight the effectiveness of the optimizations implemented in the **Samurai** kernel, delivering significantly faster boot times and a quicker time to a usable system, even on resource-constrained and **shared cloud environments**.
