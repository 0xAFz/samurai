# Samurai

Samurai is a **high-performance, low-latency** Linux kernel optimized for workloads that demand extreme responsiveness. It is **not a generic-use kernel**‚Äîit is stripped down to the bare essentials, built for **Edge, VoIP, Gaming, and VPNs**, where every microsecond counts.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings & Limitations

- **Not designed for general-purpose use.** Samurai is highly optimized and minimal‚Äîdon‚Äôt expect it to work on your smart fridge. üßä
- **Security mitigations removed.** To maximize performance, Samurai disables mitigations like Spectre/Meltdown patches. Use in trusted environments.
- **Minimal driver support.** Unused modules, drivers, and file systems have been stripped out. Check compatibility before use.
- **Logging & debugging overhead eliminated.** Samurai prioritizes raw performance over diagnostics. If you need extensive logs, this isn't the kernel for you.

## üî• Key Features

- **Extreme Low Latency:** Configured with **PREEMPT** and fine-tuned scheduling for ultra-responsive performance.
- **Tickless Kernel (NO_HZ_FULL @ 1000Hz):** Eliminates unnecessary timer interrupts, reducing overhead in real-time workloads.
- **Lightweight & Minimal:** Unused modules, drivers, and file systems removed for a streamlined footprint.
- **Security & Debugging Overheads Removed:** No **SELinux, CPU mitigations, or excessive logging**, ensuring maximum efficiency.
- **Optimized I/O Performance:** Uses **mq-deadline** scheduler for reduced disk latency.
- **eBPF/XDP Ready:** JIT always enabled for high-performance packet processing in networking applications.
