# Samurai

Samurai is a **high-performance, low-latency** Linux kernel optimized for workloads that demand extreme responsiveness. It is **not a generic-use kernel**‚Äîit is stripped down to the bare essentials, built for **Edge, VoIP, Gaming, and VPNs**, where every microsecond counts.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

- **Specialized Kernel:** Not designed for general-purpose use. Samurai is highly optimized and minimal‚Äîdon‚Äôt expect it to work on your smart fridge. üßä
- **EXTREME SECURITY WARNING:** This kernel prioritizes maximum performance by disabling virtually all security mitigations. This includes, but is not limited to, Spectre/Meltdown/L1TF/SSB mitigations, SELinux, and other hardening measures. **This configuration is HIGHLY INSECURE and should ONLY be used in trusted, isolated environments where security is explicitly NOT a concern.** If security is a priority for your use case, you MUST re-enable the necessary security mechanisms.
- **Minimal Drivers:** Limited hardware support due to the removal of unused drivers. Verify compatibility before use.
- **No Extensive Debugging:** Focus on performance means minimal logging and debugging features. Troubleshooting may be more challenging.

## üî• Key Features

- **Extreme Low Latency:** Configured with **PREEMPT** and a **Tickless Kernel (NO_HZ_FULL @ 1000Hz)** optimized for ultra-responsive performance.
- **Lightweight & Minimal Footprint:** Unused modules, drivers, and file systems removed for a streamlined footprint and reduced overhead.
- **Performance-Focused:** Deliberately excludes **SELinux, comprehensive CPU security mitigations, and excessive logging** to maximize efficiency and minimize performance impact.
- **Optimized I/O Performance:** Uses **mq-deadline** scheduler for reduced disk latency.

## Boot Time Performance

The results below showcase a significant improvement compared to the default Debian kernel.

**Testing Environment for Samurai Kernel:**

* **VM:** KVM Infra (**Shared resources**)
* **CPU:** 2 Cores
* **RAM:** 4GB

**Samurai Kernel Boot Time:**

* **Kernel Boot Time:** 0.6 seconds
* **Full System Boot Time (to userspace):** 2 seconds

**Comparison with Default Debian Kernel:**

The default Debian kernel was previously tested on a server with the following specifications:
* **VM:** KVM Infra (**Shared resources**)
* **CPU:** 4 Cores
* **RAM:** 8GB

**Default Debian Kernel Boot Time (Approximate):**

* **Kernel Boot Time:** 3 seconds
* **Full System Boot Time (to userspace):** 6 seconds

**Performance Improvement:**

Based on these tests, the **Samurai** kernel demonstrates a remarkable improvement in boot time, even when running on a virtual machine with fewer resources:

* **Kernel Boot Time Improvement:**
    * Improvement: 3 seconds - 0.6 seconds = 2.4 seconds
    * Percentage Improvement: (2.4 / 3) * 100 = **80% faster** than the default Debian kernel boot time.

* **Full System Boot Time Improvement:**
    * Improvement: 6 seconds - 2 seconds = 4 seconds
    * Percentage Improvement: (4 / 6) * 100 ‚âà **66.67% faster** than the default Debian full system boot time.

These results highlight the effectiveness of the optimizations implemented in the **Samurai** kernel, delivering significantly faster boot times and a quicker time to a usable system, even on resource-constrained and **shared cloud environments**.
